# A Simple JavaScript App
## Description
This is a simple JavaScript App in development. In order to learn the principles of and how to program with JavaScript, I am building this app. This is work in progress. There is no functionality implemented yet.

## Objective
To build a small web application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that loads data from an external API and enables the viewing of data points in detail.

## Key Features to be implemented by the end of the project
- Load data from an external source (API)
- View a list of items
- On user action (e.g., by clicking on a list item), view details for that item

## Current State
The structure of the project is set up on GitHub in order to continously receive commits.
The script file `script.js` includes an array of Pokemons which will be used to display later in the project.
